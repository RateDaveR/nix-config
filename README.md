  ## NixOS Configurations
</p>


These are my personal [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) configuration files. They
support my home lab and are evolving into a multi-host setup. While tailored to
my needs, this project serves as a reference for others or enables rapid setup
of a new Nix box using curl.

For a great starting point for your own NixOS configurations, check out
[nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).

## Setting Up a New Box

There are two main ways to set up a new box:

### Using My CDNecho $XDG_SESSION_TYPE

This is the target state (though still slightly experimental). Run:

```bash
curl -L https://cdn.davedennis.dev/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

### Using GitHub

1. Ensure `git` is available:

```bash
nix-shell -p git
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaveVED/nix-config.git && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)"
exit # Exit the nix-shell if needed.
```

3. For new setups, copy the `hardware-configuration.nix` from `/etc/nixos` to
   your configuration folder:

```bash
cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix ~/etc/nixos/
```

4. Update and rebuild:

```bash
nix flake update
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#dev
```

This minimal setup provides a ready-to-use Nix environment.

## Development Environment

You can actively develop your Nix configurations using utilities provided in the
`Makefile`. For example:

- `make format` formats files.
- `make rebuild` rebuilds the configuration.

**Note:** Run `nix-shell` to install `gnumake` for the `Makefile` to work.

### Real-Time Changes

Rebuild your workspace after updating `home-manager` configs:

```bash
make rebuild
```

### Make Commands

| Command                | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `make format`          | Formats files using Prettier.                        |
| `make garbage-collect` | Cleans up the Nix store and removes old generations. |
| `make rebuild`         | Rebuilds the NixOS configuration.                    |
| `make set-background`  | Sets the desktop background using `feh`.             |
| `make link-config`     | Creates symlinks for `.config` files.                |
| `make help`            | Displays the list of available commands.             |

## Tooling and Applications

### Core Tools

The configuration includes:

- **Neovim**: A hyperextensible text editor with custom configurations. Aliases
  `vi` and `vim` to Neovim.
- **Tmux**: A terminal multiplexer for managing persistent sessions.
- **Zsh & Oh My Zsh**: An interactive shell with theming and ease of use.
- **Git**: Basic setup with keyring integration.
- **VSCode**: For cases where a GUI editor is needed.

### Additional Configurations

- **Home-Manager Integration**: Sets up `home-manager` alongside NixOS.

```nix
{ inputs, outputs, ... }: {
  imports = [
    inputs.home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
  ];

  home-manager = {
    extraSpecialArgs = { inherit inputs outputs; };
    users = {
      your-username = import ../home-manager/home.nix;
    };
  };
}
```

### Dotfile Management with Home Manager

Manage dotfiles declaratively with `home-manager`, enabling reproducible
environments. Example configurations include:

- `home-manager/zsh/default.nix`: Minimal Zsh configuration.
- `home-manager/nvim/default.nix`: Advanced Neovim setup.

Run `man home-configuration.nix` for more `home-manager` options.

## TODO

- [ ] Bind Firefox to a key combination or explore `nohup` to prevent closure
      when the terminal is closed.
- [ ] Explore persistence options for home lab setups.
- [ ] Add more hosts and users to the configuration.
- [ ] Integrate advanced secret management tools like `sops-nix` or `pass`. - Higest, we need ssh.
- [ ] Investigate Hydra for CI/CD and binary caching.
- [ ] Research opt-in persistence setups for fully reproducible systems. - Highest
- [ ] Improve documentation and modularize configurations further.
- [ ] Custom packages, and overlays, would be a good thing to learn.
- [ ] Gotta move off `x11`, wayland? - Highest

## My Bindings

Please find a random cheet sheet of my bindings by application for reference.
Everyone has a differnt taste or style, and this is just what I like. This
is of course not all my bindings, but just some of the ones you may need to get
started.

| Binding        | Description                       | Application |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `$mod+enter`   | Opens a new terminal in           | i3          |
| `$mod+q`       | Closes the current winodw         | i3          |
| `$mod+Shift+s` | take a screenshot using flameshot | i3          |
